ðŸ§® VIP Calculator (Tkinter GUI)
This is a simple but stylish calculator built using Python's Tkinter library.
It supports basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, along with a clear (C) button and backspace (âŒ«) functionality.

âœ¨ Features:
Full GUI built using tkinter

Dark mode theme with clean fonts and layout

Supports:

Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division

Clear (C) to reset

Backspace (âŒ«) to delete last digit

Result evaluation (=)

Button-by-button creation using separate frames (no loops used for layout)

ðŸ“˜ About This Project
This is my second GUI project using Python and Tkinter.
I wanted to improve over my first attempt by focusing on:

Better layout control using pack() and separate Frames

Clean theme with custom fonts and colors

Functional code structure without relying on loops

It helped me practice StringVar, event binding, and GUI structuring.
